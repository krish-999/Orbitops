# Project: Yellowstone Fire Recovery Analysis

**Project Overview**

This project analyzes the ecological recovery of Yellowstone National Park following the devastating wildfires of 1988. Utilizing Landsat satellite imagery from Earth Explorer, we assess the park's vegetation regeneration and land cover changes over time. Our goal is to gain insights into the long-term impacts of the fires and contribute to understanding wildfire recovery in large-scale ecosystems.

**Objectives**

* Acquire and preprocess Landsat satellite imagery of Yellowstone National Park from before and after the 1988 fires.
* Analyze changes in vegetation health and land cover using indices such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and NBR (Normalized Burn Ratio).
* Assess the long-term impact of the fires on different vegetation types and land cover classes within the park.
* Contribute to the understanding of wildfire recovery processes in large-scale ecosystems.

**Background**

The Yellowstone fires of 1988 were a significant event in the park's history, burning nearly 800,000 acres. These fires, influenced by drought conditions and strong winds,  reshaped the landscape and raised questions about the park's resilience and recovery. This project examines the long-term ecological impact of these fires using satellite imagery analysis.

**Project Workflow**

**Data Collection**

1. **Earth Explorer:** Landsat satellite imagery of Yellowstone National Park was acquired through the USGS Earth Explorer platform for the years [Specify Years].
2. **Data Preprocessing:**  [Describe any preprocessing steps, e.g., atmospheric correction, cloud masking, etc.]

**Data Analysis**

1. **Vegetation Analysis:**  NDVI will be used to assess vegetation health and recovery over time.
2. **Burn Severity Analysis:** NBR will be used to analyze the severity of the burn scars and their recovery.
3. **Land Cover Classification:**  [Describe any land cover classification methods used].
4. **Change Detection:**  [Describe methods for analyzing changes in vegetation and land cover over time].

**Tools and Platforms**

* **Earth Explorer:** For accessing and downloading Landsat satellite imagery.
* **[Software Used]:**  List any GIS or remote sensing software used for analysis (e.g., QGIS, ArcGIS, ENVI).
* **[Programming Languages/Libraries]:** If applicable, list any programming languages or libraries used (e.g., Python with GDAL, Rasterio).
* **Azure Machine Learning Studio:** For collaborative notebook development and machine learning tasks.
* **Azure Storage Blob:** For storing and sharing large datasets.
* **GitHub Repository:** For collaboration and version control.
